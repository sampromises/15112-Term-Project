I implemented the defense so the Player is always calculating
and moving to the defensive 'spot' he is supposed to be at.

1) onBallDefense
	When Player is on defense and matchup has the ball.
	The defensive 'spot' is going to be:
		-a distance from the opponent
			-if opponent gets closer to the hoop, the defense Player will step-up
			-if opponent is far from the hoop, the defense Player will back-off
		-always between the opponent and the hoop
			-preventing driving

2) offBallDefense
	When Player is on defense and matchup does NOT have the ball.
	The defensive 'spot' is going to be:
		-a distance from the opponent, same as onBallDefense
		-always between the opponent and the player WITH the ball
			-preventing passes

These are both calculated using angles and distances.
