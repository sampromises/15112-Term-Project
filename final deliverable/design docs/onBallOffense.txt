More specific information on my onBallOffense decisions:

a) pass
	A Player checks if a teammate is open by calculating if there
	is a straight line between himself and the teammate.
		-Then the ball is passed midair (no one has the ball in this time).
		-During this time, the other team can intercept the ball (at a low chance)
b) shoot
	A Player determines if he is 'open' baseed on how far his defender is
	and if he is not too far from the hoop.
		-I calculated Field Goal Percentage as a function of both
		 the defender distance and shot distance (link cited in code).
	Player makes a 3-pointer if he is behind the 3-point line.
c) drive
	This was implemented by calculating the angle between the Player and the hoop
	and the angle between his defender and the hoop.
		-If the angle was enough, it means the Player is open for a drive.
d) move
	This just calls on finding a new spot, same as in offBallOffense.
e) hold
	Player stays still.

The tendencies were implemented to a default as such:
passBall = [5,3,3,2,2]
shoot =    [2,5,3,3,2]
drive =    [3,4,3,5,4]
hold =     [2,3,3,4,5]
move =     [3,3,3,2,3]
with the index corresponding to a Player's position - 1.
So a Point Guard (1) most likely pass, while a Power Forward (4) would most likely drive.

On every 'onTimerFired', onBallOffense will call random.random() to get a random chance
and then determine randomly what to do, depending on his tendencies.
