1) onBallOffense
	This is when the player has the ball and is on offense.

	The Player then looks at its tendencies, which are based on what position the player is.
	1 - Point Guard: Likes to pass, move around, be far from the basket.
	2 - Shooting Guard: Likes to shoot, move around, be far from the basket.
	3 - Small Forward: Likes to do a little bit of everything.
	4 - Power Forward: Likes to shoot, drive, and be close to the basket.
	5 - Center: Likes to shoot, drive, and be close to the basket.

	Based on these tendencies, the onBallOffense Player then decides to do one of the 5:
	a) shoot
		-first checks if he is open for a jumpshot
	b) pass
		-tries to pass to closest, open teammate to the hoop
	c) drive
		-tries to drive to the basket
	d) move
		-moves to a different spot
	e) hold
		-stands still (hold)

	More information on how these 5 are implemented are in the "design-onBallOffense.txt"

2) offBallOffense
	This is when the player does NOT have the ball and is on offense.

	There are 25 'spots' that divide the half-court region. (25 squares, more specifically)
	[see 'spots.png']
	Each player will move to a new 'spot' every so often to try to get open for a pass.
	But these spots are based on Player position, for instance...
		A point guard (1) will be farther from the hoop.
		A center (5) will only move around the hoop.
