This was done just by allowing the user to control a player on teamOne.
The user tells where the Player to go with a click of the mouse.

The user can also try to pass to a teammate by using the number keys.
(The pass will not go through if the pass is not open.)

If a pass is successful, the user will then control the Player with the ball.

The user can also shoot at any time using space.
Admittedly, this can be abused.

The user can toggle control by pressing 'u'.
